<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Understanding and Improving Hotel Booking Processes:
Despite the significance of hotel bookings in the hospitality industry, challenges persist in optimizing booking procedures to enhance efficiency and guest satisfaction. This project aims to investigate factors influencing hotel bookings, such as hotel type, booking patterns, guest demographics, and cancellation rates, to identify opportunities for streamlining the booking process and improving overall guest experiences. By leveraging data-driven insights, this study seeks to address key issues and implement strategies that enhance booking procedures and maximize hotel revenue.



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Hotel Type: The City hotel receives the highest patronage, totaling 79,330 bookings, surpassing the Resort hotel. However, City hotels also experienced the highest number of cancellations compared to the 
     Resort hotel.</b>
- <b>Peak Booking Periods: August emerges as the peak booking period with 13,877 bookings, followed by July and May. These months coincide with the summer season, a time when vacation travel is prevalent. </b>
- <b>Demographic Preferences: Approximately 28.6% of all guests originated from Portugal, followed by Great Britain, France, Spain, and Germany. This suggests that the majority of hotel guests hail from European 
     countries.</b>
- <b>Market Segments/Booking channels: Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) accounted for 47.3% of total bookings, amounting to 56,477 reservations. </b>
- <b>Highest ADR (Average Daily Rate): Daniel Walter from Portugal recorded the highest Average Daily Rate of $5,400 at a City hotel, without eligibility for a refund.</b>
- <b>Cancellation Rates: The absence of deposits for most bookings contributed to a significant number of cancellations. Deposits serve as a commitment indicator for guests to honor their reservations.</b>
- <b>Customer Retention: Repeated guests comprise only 3.19% of total bookings, indicating that the majority of reservations are made by first-time guests or customers.</b>
 
 


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Cancellation Management Strategies: Implement measures to mitigate cancellations, particularly for City hotels, such as introducing flexible cancellation policies or requiring deposits for bookings to 
     ensure commitment from guests.</b>
- <b>Seasonal Pricing Strategy: Capitalize on peak booking periods in August, July, and May by implementing dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue during high-demand seasons.</b>
- <b>Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Leverage demographic preferences to tailor marketing efforts towards European countries, focusing on promotions and offers that appeal to guests from Portugal, Great Britain, 
     France, Spain, and Germany.</b>
- <b>Enhanced Online Presence: Strengthen partnerships with Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) to further penetrate the online booking market segment, optimizing visibility and accessibility for potential guests.</b>
- <b>Customer Loyalty Programs: Develop initiatives to increase customer retention, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers for repeated guests, to foster long-term relationships and encourage repeat 
     bookings.</b>
- <b>Review Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and pricing structure to ensure competitiveness within the market while maintaining profitability, considering factors such as demand trends 
     and guest preferences.</b>
- <b>Optimization of Room Allocation: Allocate resources and prioritize inventory management strategies to accommodate fluctuations in demand during peak booking periods, ensuring efficient utilization of hotel 
     facilities and maximizing revenue potential.<b>
